# Credit Card Fraud Detection - CODSOFT Internship

## Objective
Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Dataset
Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Scaling
3. Handling Imbalanced Dataset
4. Train-Test Split
5. Logistic Regression Model Training
6. Model Evaluation using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Result
The model successfully identifies fraudulent transactions using classification techniques.

## Learning Outcome
Understood real-world fraud detection workflow, preprocessing, and evaluation of imbalanced datasets.
